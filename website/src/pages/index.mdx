# React Native Places Autocomplete

A provider-agnostic location autocomplete component for React Native. Use built-in providers (OpenStreetMap, OpenCage, Mapbox, Google, Geoapify, LocationIQ, HERE, TomTom) or a custom provider via `fetchSuggestions`.

- Lightweight and highly customizable
- Built-in providers with `provider` + `providerConfig`
- `queryOptions` to pass provider-specific query params
- Infinite fetching / pagination support for providers that expose it
