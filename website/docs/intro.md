![Supported Providers](/img/providers.png)

Welcome to the documentation for react-native-places-autocomplete â€” a provider-agnostic location autocomplete component for React Native.

This site documents usage, built-in providers (OpenStreetMap, OpenCage, Mapbox, Google Places, Geoapify, LocationIQ, HERE, TomTom), provider configuration, attribution requirements, and advanced options such as `queryOptions` and infinite fetching.

Key topics:

- Getting started
- Using built-in providers or a custom fetch function
- Query options and providerConfig
- Attribution requirements for each provider

If you want a quick interactive example, try the Expo Snack linked in the project README.
